As a team leader i have distributed the tasks on the team members, i have decided to work with Agile methodology so i was making a meeting each one or two weeks with the team members to presenting the work done
i was responsible for the AI modules which are:

### My part in the project consists of three main modules:

* **Module 1:** An AI based smart chatbot called "Caroline" talking to the patient 
and taking its disease symptoms by text or voice messages, then diagnosing the disease and 
recommend making some tests or medical imaging scans to do as x-ray, MRI, Complete Blood Count CBC, ... in addition, given 
information about the predicted disease as an overview, symptoms, and 
treatments. It can predict 30 diseases such as (Breast Cancer, Influenza, Covid 19, Stroke, ...) 

* **Module 2:** A sequence of AI Computer Vision models for scanning medical 
imaging scans and medical tests it can scan (X-ray, MRI, CT, OCT, CBC, or Food images), 
detect the image type (Image Recognition), if it is medical imaging image, 
applying anatomical recognition, disease evaluation, disease diagnosis, and also in tumor or bone fraction cases. It can locate the tumor or the fraction using image segmentation. It can predict 25 disease types such as (Bone Fracture, Brain Tumor, Covid 19, Breast Cancer, ...). It can read the Complete Blood Count (CBC) test images and evaluate overall health and diagnose conditions like anemia, infections, clotting disorders, and blood cancers by analyzing red and white blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets. It also can recognize 101 food types from images and shows the approximate number of calories per gram.

* **Module 3:** An ensemble Machine Learning (Random Forest) Model for scan Electrocardiography ECG and diagnosis the heart diseases.

* In addition of making algorithm for MBTI personality analysis test.

## 2. Implementation Methodology
Using transfer learning to get a pre-trained models on a huge dataset image net and customize their input layer shape to be suitable with the images and customize the output layer structure and activation function as need, so the models have an initial value for the parameters then they train faster and gives better accuracy. 

The AI module is designed in different parts. There are a Natural Language Processing NLP, Deep Learning Computer Vision Classification, Image Segmentation, Optical Character Recognition OCR, Large Language Model LLM, Speech Recognition, and Machine Learning Models all are combined together to mimic a doctor for all specialties.

AI based smart chatbot called "Caroline" talking to the patient and taking its disease symptoms by text or voice messages, then diagnosing the disease and recommend making some tests or medical imaging scans to do as x-ray, MRI, Complete Blood Count CBC, ... in addition, given information about the predicted disease as an overview, symptoms, and treatments.

**Methodology:** Collecting the data from several datasets contains the diseases symptoms and the disease diagnosis as a Json format contains Tags, Patterns, and Response. The tags contains the class name as "greeting", "diseases name as Skin Cancer,  Influenza, ..." making class for each disease, patterns contains examples of the user expected questions, and the response contains the many options for the output. after making the dataset, applying preprocessing techniques (Tokenization and Stemming, ...). i have developed a deep learnoing LSTM model for the Chatbot predictions taking the preprocessed patient symptoms message as input and predict the class from the 44 classes then chooses randomly from the saved responses.

There is option speech to the chatbot using voice messages as i have add a Speech Recognition model to detect voices and convert it into text then pass to the chatbot model.
